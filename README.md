*A Rubik's cube in processing with better use of matrix transforms*

Based on Daniel Shiffmann's Rubik's cube coding challenge from [The Coding Train](https://youtu.be/8U2gsbNe1Uo)

Using only 3D matrix transforms to calculate all movements. Very straightforward code.

I also tried making controls easyer with face select by keyboard letter, then rotate with arrows.
